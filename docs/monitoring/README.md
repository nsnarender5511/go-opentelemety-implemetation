**Purpose:** This page provides a high-level overview of the monitoring and observability setup for the application.
**Audience:** Developers, DevOps, Students
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of observability concepts (Traces, Metrics, Logs).
**Related Pages:** [Telemetry Setup](./Telemetry Setup.md), [Logging Details](./Logging Details.md), [Tracing Details](./Tracing Details.md), [Key Metrics](./Key Metrics.md), [SigNoz Dashboards](./SigNoz Dashboards.md), [`common/telemetry/attributes/attributes.go`](../../common/telemetry/attributes/attributes.go)

## 1. Overview & Key Concepts

The application is instrumented using OpenTelemetry to generate traces, metrics, and logs. This data is sent via OTLP to an OpenTelemetry Collector, which processes it and forwards it to SigNoz Cloud for analysis and visualization.

*   **Key Components:**
    *   OpenTelemetry Go SDK (within services)
    *   OpenTelemetry Collector (separate service)
    *   SigNoz Cloud (backend)
*   **Core Responsibility:** Provide visibility into the application's behavior, performance, and errors.
*   **Why it Matters:** Enables effective debugging, performance monitoring, and understanding of the system's health.

## 2. Key Observability Signals

Detailed information on each signal type can be found on their respective pages:

*   **Traces:** Distributed traces track requests as they flow through services. See [Tracing Details](./Tracing Details.md).
*   **Metrics:** Quantitative measurements of application performance and resource usage. See [Key Metrics](./Key Metrics.md).
*   **Logs:** Structured logs provide contextual information about events. See [Logging Details](./Logging Details.md).

## 3. Common Telemetry Attributes

To ensure consistency across signals, common attribute keys are defined in `common/telemetry/attributes/attributes.go`. These include:

*   **Standard:** `exception.message`, `exception.type`
*   **Custom:**
    *   `db.file.path`: Path to the database file.
    *   `app.product.id`: Identifier for a product.
    *   `product.new_stock`: New stock level for a product.
    *   `app.products.count`: Count of products.

These attributes may appear on spans, logs, or as metric dimensions.

## 4. Tools & Backend

*   **Instrumentation:** OpenTelemetry Go SDK
*   **Collection:** OpenTelemetry Collector
*   **Backend & Visualization:** SigNoz Cloud (See [SigNoz Dashboards](./SigNoz Dashboards.md))

## 5. Visuals & Diagrams

See [Telemetry Setup](./Telemetry Setup.md) for a diagram of the overall telemetry pipeline.

## 6. Teaching Points & Demo Walkthrough

*   **Key Takeaway:** The combination of Traces, Metrics, and Logs (the "three pillars of observability") provides a comprehensive view of the application. OpenTelemetry provides a standardized way to generate and collect this data.
*   **Demo Steps:**
    1.  Briefly explain the three pillars.
    2.  Show the [Telemetry Setup](./Telemetry Setup.md) page and diagram.
    3.  Navigate to [SigNoz Dashboards](./SigNoz Dashboards.md) (once populated) and show examples of traces, metrics (dashboards), and logs, explaining how they correlate.
*   **Common Pitfalls / Questions:**
    *   What's the difference between logging and tracing? (Logging is about discrete events, tracing is about the lifecycle of a request).
    *   Where do metrics come from? (Can be generated by the SDK based on application code, or collected from infrastructure like the `docker_stats` receiver).
