# Quick Start

**Purpose:** Provide the minimal steps required to run the entire application stack locally and observe basic telemetry output in SigNoz.
**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose installed.
**Related Pages:** [Running Locally with Docker Compose](./development/Running_Locally_with_Docker_Compose.md), [SigNoz Dashboards](./monitoring/SigNoz_Dashboards.md)

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

(Assuming you have the project code already)

```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd /path/to/Signoz_assignment
```

---

## 2. Start the Application Stack

Use Docker Compose to build and start all services (product-service, product-simulator, otel-collector, SigNoz):

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

*   `--build` ensures images are built if they don't exist or if code changes.
*   Add `-d` to run in the background: `docker compose up --build -d`.
*   Wait a minute or two for all services to initialize, especially SigNoz.

---

## 3. Access Services

*   **SigNoz UI:** Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301).
    *   This is the frontend for the SigNoz observability platform.
*   **Product Service API (Optional):** You can interact with the API directly:
    *   `curl http://localhost:8082/products`
    *   `curl http://localhost:8082/health`

---

## 4. Observe Telemetry

1.  **Navigate SigNoz:** In the SigNoz UI ([http://localhost:3301](http://localhost:3301)):
    *   Go to the **Services** section. You should see `product-service` listed.
    *   Explore **Traces** to see requests flowing through the `product-service` (generated by the `product-simulator`).
    *   Check **Logs** for structured logs from the services.
    *   Look at **Dashboards** (you might need to explore default dashboards or create new ones based on [Key Metrics](./monitoring/Key_Metrics.md)). Docker container metrics should also be available.
2.  **Simulator Output:** The `product-simulator` runs automatically, making requests to the `product-service`. You can view its logs:
    ```bash
    docker logs product-simulator -f
    ```

---

## 5. Stopping the Stack

When finished, stop and remove the containers:

```bash
docker compose down
```
